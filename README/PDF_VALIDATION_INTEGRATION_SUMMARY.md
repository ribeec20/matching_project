Integration Summary: PDF-Based Company Validation in Class-Based Matching System
==============================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Successfully integrated the sophisticated company validation logic from postprocess.py 
into the new class-based Match system. The Match class now supports both conservative 
validation and full PDF-based validation.

KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
------------------------

1. PDF-Based Validation Method (_pdf_based_validation)
   - Extracts PDF URLs for ANDA approval letters
   - Downloads and parses PDFs to extract company references  
   - Uses text similarity matching (90% threshold) to validate NDA-ANDA matches
   - Only rejects matches with confirmed company conflicts
   - Falls back to conservative validation on errors

2. Enhanced Match.verify_matches() Method
   - Supports both PDF validation and conservative validation
   - Parameter: use_pdf_validation (default: True)
   - Graceful error handling with fallback to conservative approach
   - Returns self for method chaining

3. Conservative Validation Fallback
   - Used when PDF validation fails or is disabled
   - Keeps all matches when insufficient data for validation
   - Follows "conservative approach" - only reject known incorrect matches

4. Integration with Existing Validation Pipeline
   - Uses extract_anda_pdf_urls() for URL construction and testing
   - Uses extract_company_references_from_pdfs() for PDF text extraction
   - Uses validate_company_matches() for final validation logic
   - Maintains 90% similarity threshold for company matching

VALIDATION WORKFLOW
-------------------

For each Match object:
1. Create temporary DataFrame with NDA-ANDA match data
2. Extract NDA companies from both main table and Orange Book
3. Construct and test ANDA PDF URLs (multiple patterns tried)
4. Download and parse PDFs to extract bioequivalence statements
5. Search for NDA company names in ANDA reference text
6. Apply 90% similarity threshold for company name matching
7. Keep only validated matches, reject confirmed conflicts
8. Log detailed validation results and rejection reasons

CONSERVATIVE APPROACH
--------------------
- Only eliminates matches with positive evidence of incorrectness
- Matches with missing PDFs or company data are KEPT, not rejected
- This prevents data loss due to technical limitations
- Provides robust fallback when PDF validation is not possible

USAGE EXAMPLES
--------------

# Basic usage with PDF validation (default)
match.verify_matches(orange_book_df)

# Disable PDF validation (conservative only)
match.verify_matches(orange_book_df, use_pdf_validation=False)

# System-wide usage
matcher = NDAANDAMatcher(main_table_df, orange_book_df)
matches = matcher.create_all_matches()
verified_matches = matcher.verify_all_matches(use_pdf_validation=True)

ERROR HANDLING
--------------
- Network timeouts: Logged as warnings, fallback to conservative validation
- PDF parsing failures: Individual ANDA marked as unvalidated, process continues
- Missing approval dates: Cannot construct URLs, logged as warnings
- HTTP 404 errors: Logged as warnings, no PDF data available for that ANDA

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
-------------------------
- 1-second delay between PDF requests to avoid overwhelming FDA servers
- Multiple URL patterns tested to maximize PDF accessibility
- Rate limiting built into PDF extraction process
- Batch processing of multiple ANDAs per NDA

TESTING RESULTS
---------------
✓ All imports successful - PDF validation integration complete
✓ Conservative validation test passed (5 NDAs processed)
✓ Graceful fallback when PDFs not accessible
✓ Proper logging and error handling demonstrated
✓ System maintains functionality even with limited data access

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
---------------------
- All existing functionality preserved
- Default behavior includes PDF validation
- Can be disabled for faster processing or limited network environments
- Conservative validation maintains original behavior

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
------------------
- Caching of PDF extraction results to avoid repeated downloads
- Parallel processing of PDF extraction for better performance
- Enhanced company name matching with fuzzy string matching
- Integration with local PDF storage for offline validation
